Goals of project - 

provide non triivial implenattion of grass generationa and rendering 

This is a demo so solution should be time effecient to implement ie do not spend 4 hour improving performance by 5%

Should be online and available to whowever may want to access it (should be taken into considertion for performanc and which platforms it can run on)

Research - 


Core Deliverable 

- Represenation of grass using bezier curves 

- Insance rendering for field 

- grass should retian length 

- wind patterns using noise


Extensions -

- level of detail

- culling 

- shading

- anti alising

- debug ui

- clumping

- grass blade thicken depedning on view space

Further exploration - 

- whilst I have found splines used for creating and rendering I have not found the use bezier curves used for short fur rending - at least I have not seen it from a roudamenatry search 


- Frustum culling
